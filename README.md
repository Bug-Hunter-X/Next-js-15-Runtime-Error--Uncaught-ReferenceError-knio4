# Next.js 15 Runtime Error: Uncaught ReferenceError

This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Next.js 15 applications where accessing an undefined variable within a functional component leads to an unhandled error.  The error occurs when a variable is referenced that has not been properly defined within the scope of the component. 

## Problem
The `about.js` file attempts to access a variable (`nonexistentVariable`) that is undefined. This results in a runtime error causing the page to crash. 

## Solution
The `aboutSolution.js` file demonstrates a solution. The error is resolved by ensuring that all variables are correctly declared and assigned values before they are used.  This can involve using conditional rendering to gracefully handle cases where a variable might be undefined or using default values to prevent the error entirely.

## Setup
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

Try accessing the /about route to see the error in `about.js` then check out the solution in `aboutSolution.js`
